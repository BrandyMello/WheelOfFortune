//Wheel is a class with access to the data correlated to the wheel options.
//a property of this class can be wheelData where the array of the entirety of options for the wheel are stored --- this will be found via a method -
// the method to find the entirety of wheelData can be findWheelData
  //findWheelData will go into the data array and pull out the one array correlated with this wheel. 
//will need a currentWheel property correlated to the current wheel dispayed on the dom --- will need method
  //generateCurrentWheel wheel need to randomly have to pull out a minumum of six options, store the return value in currentWheel property

//We will need a property to hold the value of what the wheel lands on when it stops after each spin (wheelPrize) via a method

// a method to spin the wheel - findWheelPrize (spins the wheel) that returns a value correlated to the wheelPrize that is currently available for this turn. 
//set this return value to the wheelPrize property

//dom needs to "land on" wheelPrize and display the potential prize. 

// spinWheel will be called from the Turn class when a player clicks the spin button
//and that will really just call the findWheelPrize method inside of Wheel Class

# GameTime Wheel-Of-Fortune!

This is the group project for Module Two of Four at Turing School Of Software and Design located in Denver, Colorado. Each Module is 6 weeks. Turing is a 7 month full time program. 
Timeline for the project to be completed is 13 days.  The details of this project are outlined in [this project spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/game-time.htmll).

This is a collaboration from:
* Lacy Rudd  [github account](https://github.com/dawnlunacy) <br>

## Summary
### The learning goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 
* Write a program from scratch
* Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
* Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
* Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
* `Sass` in CSS

* "For this project you will solidify your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building out a game show. This is an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than you have with previous projects. This is also an opportunity for you to build out a program based on user stories - which is more aligned to what you can expect to see working with product managers in a production environment."

## Testing

* This project implements Test Driven Development written by the collaborators. We used the `mocha` and `chai` libraries to complete testing.
* This project also implements `spies` to implement testing. 

## Linting Your Code

* This project implements the use of a linter. 

## Data Model
* This project uses a `fetch API` to retrieve the data that is being used to play the game. 

## Packages

* Wheel-Of-Fortune uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 

## User-Interface 
* This is also the second project at Turing where a prompt for the UI/UX design is not provided. We were allowed the creative freedom to design this.

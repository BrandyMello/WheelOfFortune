2 week group project for FE Mod 2 (weeks 4-5)

Background and Description
For this project you will solidify your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building out a game show. This is an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than you have with previous projects. This is also an opportunity for you to build out a program based on user stories - which is more aligned to what you can expect to see working with product managers in a production environment.

Building software, at its core, is about solving problems. Generally speaking, the first step in finding a solution to the problem is to be sure that you have clearly identified the problem as well what features the solution must incorporate. From here, we can flesh out the requirements that specify what our program should have. You will be assigned to build one of the following games:

Wheel of Fortune
Jeopardy
Family Feud
The rules of your assigned game will serve as the requirements for the spec.

Goals and Objectives
Write a program from scratch
Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
Technologies
Youâ€™ll be working with some new technologies for this project:

the fetch API for sending/receiving data
Sass for getting fancy with your CSS


# GameTime Wheel-Of-Fortune!

This is the group project for Mod Two at Turing School Of Software and Design located in Denver, Colorado. 
Timeline for the project to be completed is 13 days.  The details of this project are outlined in [this project spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/game-time.htmll).

This is a collaboration from:
* Lacy Rudd  [github account](https://github.com/dawnlunacy) <br>

## Summary
### The learning goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 
* Write a program from scratch
* Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
* Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
* Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
* `Sass` in CSS

* "For this project you will solidify your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building out a game show.

## Testing

* This project implements Test Driven Development written by the collaborators. We used the `mocha` and `chai` libraries to complete testing.
* This project also implements `spies` to implement testing. 

## Linting Your Code

* This project implements the use of a linter. 

## Data Model
* This project uses a `fetch API` to retrieve the data that is being used to play the game. 

## Packages

* Wheel-Of-Fortune uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 

## User-Interface 
* This is also the second project at Turing where a prompt for the UI/UX design is not provided. We were allowed the creative freedom to design this.
